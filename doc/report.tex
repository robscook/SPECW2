\chapter*{Introduction}
We have been commissioned
by a financial services company,
to assess the feasibility of a system migration of a
legacy mainframe to the more recent Sun Solaris and
J2EE platform, while providing the expertise and guidance necessary.

A new application titled, 'Payments and Clearing' is expected to
utilize this new system.
It receives payments via \textit{http} from three separate business channels.
The application is comprised of four major components.
These are \textit{Inbound}, \textit{Message processing},
\textit{Processing and exception management} and the \textit{Oracle Server}.

The primary KPS identified during the performance and
scalability assessment was 'Process Peak Hour Current Processing Day Payments'.
There are two NFR's for this application,
'File Inter Arrival Time secs' (NFR1) and
'File 95 th Response Time secs' (NFR2).
